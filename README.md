## Project Description
This project is divided into two parts. In the first part, we were asked to implement a low-level machine that supports arithmetic, boolean, and flow control instructions. Later, we were required to implement a compiler to compile an imperative language into the previously developed low-level machine.

## Part 1: Implementation of a Low-Level Machine
### Data Structure

**Inst:**

The Inst data structure represents machine instructions.

```haskell
data Inst =
  Push Integer | Add | Mult | Sub | Tru | Fals | Equ | Le | And | Neg | Fetch String | Store String | Noop |
  Branch Code Code | Loop Code Code
  deriving Show
```

- Push n: inserts the value n into the stack
- Add: adds the two values at the top of the stack and inserts the result into the stack
- Mult: multiplies the two values at the top of the stack and inserts the result into the stack
- Sub: subtracts the value at the top of the stack from the 2nd value and inserts the result into the stack
- Tru: inserts the value tt into the stack
- Fals: inserts the value ff into the stack
- Equ: checks if the two values at the top of the stack are equal and inserts the result into the stack
- Le: checks if the value at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the second and inserts the result into the stack
- And: checks if the two values at the top of the stack are equal to tt and inserts the result into the stack
- Neg: inverts the boolean value at the top of the stack
- Fetch var: inserts the value associated with the variable var into the stack
- Store var: removes the value at the top of the stack and inserts the value associated with the variable var into the state
- Noop: Instruction with no effects
- Branch c1 c2: if the value at the top of the stack is tt, execute the list of instructions c1; otherwise, execute the list of instructions c2
- Loop c1 c2: execute c1, placing tt or ff on the top of the stack. If tt is at the top of the stack, execute c2 and then execute Loop c1 c2 again; otherwise, end execution

**State:**

The state is represented by a Binary Search Tree, where each node contains a key (corresponding to the name of a variable), an associated value, and two sub-trees.

```haskell	
data State = Empty 
            | Node String String State State
```

This data structure supports the following operations:
- newState: creates a new empty state
- fromList: creates a new state from a list of pairs (variable, value)
- insert: inserts a new pair (variable, value) into the state
- load: returns the value associated with a variable
- toList: returns a list of pairs (variable, value) from a state
- toStr: returns a string from a state

**Stack:**

The stack is represented by a list of strings.

```haskell
newtype Stack = Stk [String] deriving Show
```

In this data structure, the following operations exist:
- newStack: creates a new empty stack
- fromList: creates a new stack from a list of strings
- push: inserts a new string into the stack
- pop: removes the string at the top of the stack
- top: returns the string at the top of the stack
- isEmpty: checks if the stack is empty

### Program Logic

The `run` function takes the arguments `(code, stack, state)`. As long as the code list is not empty, the `run` function executes the instruction at the top of the code list and recursively calls the `run` function with the remaining list of instructions.

# Part 2: Compiler for an Imperative Language

In this part of the project, we were tasked with implementing a compiler for an imperative language. This process involved three main stages.

![Lexer-Parser-Compiler](docs/Lexer-Parser-Compiler.png)

| String        | x := 5; x := x - 1;                                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lexer Result      | [TokVar "x",TokAssign,TokNumber 5,TokSemicolon,TokVar "x",TokAssign,TokVar "x",TokSub,TokNumber 1,TokSemicolon] |
| Parser Result     | [AssignStm "x" (NumExp 5), AssignStm "x" (SubExp (VarExp "x") (NumExp 1))] |
| Compile Result    | [Push 5,Store "x",Push 1,Fetch "x",Sub,Store "x"]             |

### Lexer
Responsible for assigning tokens to each element of the language. In our case, the `lexer` function takes a string and returns a list of tokens.

**Tokens:**
Our language supports the following tokens:

```haskell
data Token = TokAssign          -- ':='
           | TokSemicolon       -- ';'
           | TokVar String      -- variable name
           | TokNumber Integer  -- number
           | TokOpenParen       -- '('
           | TokCloseParen      --')'
           | TokAdd             -- '+'
           | TokSub             -- '-'
           | TokMul             -- '*'
           | TokIf              -- 'if'
           | TokThen            -- 'then'
           | TokElse            -- 'else'
           | TokWhile           -- 'while'
           | TokDo              -- 'do'
           | TokBoolEqu         -- '='
           | TokIntEqu          -- '=='
           | TokLE              -- '<=' 
           | TokNot             -- 'not'
           | TokAnd             -- 'and'
           | TokTrue            -- 'True'
           | TokFalse           -- 'False'    
           deriving (Show, Eq)
```

Our lexer works as follows:
- **Spaces:** Ignored.
- **Letters:** The `lexIdentifier` function checks if the string is a reserved word or a variable (starting with a lowercase letter) and returns the corresponding token.
- **Numbers:** The `lexNumber` function returns the TokNumber token (number).
- **Single-character operators, parentheses, and semicolons:** The `lexer` function adds the corresponding token to the list of tokens.
- **Operators with more than one character:** Operators like `:=`, `==`, `=`, and `<=` are handled by the `lexAssign`, `lexEqual`, and `lexLessEqual` functions, respectively.

After each of the previous steps, the `lexer` function calls itself recursively with the remaining string until the string is empty.

### Parser
Responsible for transforming the list of tokens into a syntax tree. This is where we handle the precedence of operators. We define three different data structures to represent arithmetic expressions, boolean expressions, and statements.

```haskell
data Aexp = NumExp Integer      -- Integer
          | VarExp String        -- Variable
          | AddExp Aexp Aexp    -- Addition  
          | SubExp Aexp Aexp    -- Subtraction       
          | MulExp Aexp Aexp    -- Multiplication  
          deriving Show

data Bexp = TrueExp             -- True     
          | FalseExp            -- False
          | EqArExp Aexp Aexp   -- Equality between two arithmetic expressions
          | EqBoolExp Bexp Bexp -- Equality between two boolean expressions   
          | LeExp Aexp Aexp     -- Less than or equal between two arithmetic expressions    
          | NotExp Bexp         -- Negation of a boolean expression
          | AndExp Bexp Bexp    -- Conjunction between two boolean expressions
          deriving Show

data Stm = AssignStm String Aexp -- Assignment 
          | SeqStm [Stm]         -- Sequence of statements
          | IfStm Bexp Stm Stm   
          | WhileStm Bexp Stm    
          deriving Show
```

The `parser` function applies the `lexer` function to the string and calls the `buildData` function with the resulting list of tokens. The `buildData` function takes this list of tokens and returns a syntax tree.

```haskell 
parser :: String -> Program
parser = buildData . lexer
```

The `buildData` function repeatedly calls the `parseStm` function until the list of remaining tokens is empty and checks if the list of tokens has been processed in its entirety. Otherwise, an error is thrown.

```haskell
buildData :: [Token] -> Program
buildData tokens = 
  case parseStm tokens of
    Just (stm, []) -> [stm] 
    Just (stm, restTokens) -> stm : buildData restTokens
    _ -> error $ "Unexpected error parsing statement (buildData): " ++ show tokens
```

#### Instruction Parser
The `parseStm` function is responsible for processing statements, which can be of four different types: assignment, if-then-else, while, and sequence of statements. Depending on the type of statement, the `parseStm` function then calls the `parseAexp`, `parseBexp`, or `parseSeqStm` function, as seen in the following code excerpt.

```haskell
data Stm = AssignStm String Aexp 
          | SeqStm [Stm]      
          | IfStm Bexp Stm Stm   
          | WhileStm Bexp Stm    
          deriving Show

parseStm :: [Token] -> Maybe (Stm, [Token])
parseStm tokens = case tokens of
  TokVar var : TokAssign : restTokens ->
    case parseAexp restTokens of
      Just (aexp, restTokens1) -> case restTokens1 of
        TokSemicolon : restTokens2 -> Just (AssignStm var aexp, restTokens2)
      ...

  TokIf : restTokens1 ->
    case parseBexp restTokens1 of
      ...
          case parseStm restTokens3 of
            ...
              case parseStm restTokens4 of
                Just (SeqStm stm2, TokSemicolon : restTokens5) ->
                  Just (IfStm bexp stm1 (SeqStm stm2), restTokens5)
                Just (SeqStm stm2, restTokens5) -> 
                  error $ "Missing semicolon after 'else' statement" ++ show restTokens5
                Just (stm2, restTokens5) -> 
                  Just (IfStm bexp stm1 stm2, restTokens5)
                ...

  TokWhile : restTokens1 ->
    case parseBexp restTokens1 of
        ...
          case parseStm restTokens3 of
              Just (SeqStm stm, TokSemicolon : restTokens5) ->
                Just (WhileStm bexp (SeqStm stm), restTokens5)
              Just (SeqStm stm, restTokens5) -> 
                error $ "Missing semicolon after 'else' statement" ++ show restTokens5
              Just (stm, restTokens5) -> 
                Just (WhileStm bexp stm, restTokens5)

  TokOpenParen : restTokens1 ->
    case parseSeqStm restTokens1 of
      case parseSeqStm restTokens1 of
        Just (stmList, restTokens2) -> Just (SeqStm stmList, restTokens2)

  _ -> error $ "Unexpected error parsing statement: " ++ show tokens
```

#### Arithmetic Expressions Parser
In parsing arithmetic functions, we use a set of auxiliary functions that allow us to handle the precedence of operators. The precedence of operators is handled as follows: first, expressions within parentheses are processed, followed by multiplications, and finally additions and subtractions.

The `parseAexp` function takes a list of tokens, calls the `parseSumOrDifOrProdOrIntOrPar` function, and checks if the list of tokens has been processed in its entirety. Otherwise, an error is thrown.

#### Boolean Expressions Parser
The `parseBexp` function takes a list of tokens, calls the `parseAndOrMore` function. If the list of tokens has been fully processed, the `parseBexp` function returns. Similarly, it checks if the first token not consumed by the parser is a `TokThen` or `TokDo`. If it is, the function returns with the remaining tokens. Otherwise, an error is thrown.

```haskell
parseBexp :: [Token] -> Maybe (Bexp, [Token])
parseBexp tokens = case parseAndOrMore tokens of
  Just (bexp, []) -> Just (bexp, [])
  Just (bexp, TokThen:rest) -> Just (bexp, TokThen:rest)
  Just (bexp, TokDo:rest) -> Just (bexp, TokDo:rest)
  Just ( _, rest) -> error $ "Unparsed tokens (parseB): " ++ show rest
  _ -> error $ "Unexpected error parsing boolean expression: " ++ show tokens
```

### Compiler
The compiler is responsible for processing a list of ASTs, generating code for the low-level machine implemented in the first part of the project.

While this list is not empty, the `compile` function compiles the tree at the top of the list, invoking the `compA` or `compB` functions. After processing the instruction, the `compile` function is called recursively with the remaining list of instructions.

The `compA` function is responsible for processing arithmetic expressions (NumExp, VarExp, AddExp, SubExp, and MulExp), while the `compB` function is responsible for processing boolean expressions (TrueExp, FalseExp, EqArExp, EqBoolExp, LeExp, NotExp, and AndExp).

## Code Execution
To execute the program, it is necessary to have [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) installed. After installation, simply execute the following command in the src folder:

```haskell
ghci main.hs
```
